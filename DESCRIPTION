Description: 
        Functionality required to efficiently use R with IBM(R) Db2(R)
        Warehouse offerings (formerly IBM dashDB(R)) and IBM Db2 for z/OS(R) in
        conjunction with IBM Db2 Analytics Accelerator for z/OS.
        Many basic and complex R operations are pushed down into the database, 
        which removes the main memory boundary of R and allows to make full 
        use of parallel processing in the underlying database.
        For executing R-functions in a multi-node environment in parallel the idaTApply() function
        requires the 'SparkR' package (<https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html>).
        The optional 'ggplot2' package is needed for the plot.idaLm() function only.
