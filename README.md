Getting Started
---------------
The ibmdbR package works with IBM DB2© for Linux and Windows Version 10.5 (abbreviated to DB2), and with 
IBM dashDB© (abbreviated to dashDB). Before you start, you must install DB2 or provision an instance of dashDB on the cloud (see link below). 

If you use dashDB on the web, everything is pre-configured and ready to be used 
from your web browser. If you connect to a DB2 server or use dashDB remotely, you must first install 
the appropriate client driver packages. For DB2, the driver packages come with the product; for dashDB, 
you can download them from the dashDB web console. 

After you install the driver packages you must configure an ODBC source. Refer to the documentation of 
your operating system for information on how to do this.

For an introduction to the package and first steps, see the package vignette "Use IBM In-Database Analytics with R".
